        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section><h3><a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/">Space Jam</a></h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>
                <p>This website is a recreation of the website made to advertise the hit 1996 movie Space Jam! 
                It uses the planets and other images as clickable links to different things relating to the movie. 
                It was taken down in 2022 by Warner Brothers (after 26 years!) but public outcry lead for the site made WB bring the website back
                as a cultural touchstone for internet users from that era. </p>
            </li>
        </ul> CRAP evaluation:
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Bad. There are neon green backgrounds with yellow text, and it is really hard to read on some pages.</li>
            <li>Repition: Bad. There is no repetition among pages on the site. Each one is unique and takes lots of user effort to navigate.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Good. When bulk text is given it is properly aligned and spacing is kept predictable.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Bad. Links and different icons are unevenly spaced and in some cases are hidden behind images on seperate sides of a file.</li>
        </ul></section>
        <section><h3><a href="https://www.cssdesignawards.com/">CSS Design Awards Website</a></h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>
                <p>This website is dedicated to websites who have good design and follow CRAP design principles. For a website that does this, 
                    it should have good design as well. </p>
            </li>
        </ul> 
        CRAP evaluation:
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Good. The dark text is very readable and contrasts well with the off-white background. </li>
            <li>Repition: Good. It repeats the design well and it is very predictable.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Good. All things are spaced out evenly and are aligned with one another.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Good. Different parts of the site have a proximity that demonstrates a seperation while still being close enough to be uncomfortable for the user.</li>
