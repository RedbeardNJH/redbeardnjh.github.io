            <h2>What is Flesh and Blood?</h2>
            <p>A trading card game (TCG) is a type of game where players collect, trade, and use specially designed cards to compete against each other. 
                Each card typically represents characters, abilities, or resources that can be strategically combined during gameplay. 
                TCGs often involve building personalized decks, encouraging both strategic thinking and social interaction through trading and matches.</p>
                <p>Flesh and Blood is a trading card game where two players simulate combat between two individuals in a high fantasy world. 
                The game is played using a deck of 80 trading cards, consisting of your character, equipment for the character, and actions your character can do.</p>

            <h2>Where to play Flesh and Blood?</h2>
            <p>Local game stores are community hubs where trading card game players can buy cards, find new products, and participate in organized events. 
                They provide a welcoming space for players to meet, trade, and compete, helping to build vibrant local TCG communities.</p>
            <p>The LGS I go to on a weekly basis is named Get Some Game and is a 20 minute drive from the university. There are many more across the USA that have Flesh and Blood events, and all of them usually hold weekly events.</p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How do you play Flesh and Blood?</h2>
            <p>The basis of the game comes from the fact that you have a deck of 60 cards, and these cards represent abilities and attacks your character can do during the game. 
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img id="howQ" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flesh_and_Blood_card_game_2022.jpg/1920px-Flesh_and_Blood_card_game_2022.jpg" alt="People playing FaB">

            </figure>
            <p>At the start of a turn you draw up to your characters intellect, which is usually 4. 
                You can then use those cards to attack, however you need to return other cards in your hand to the deck in order to do so. 
                Therefore you usually cannot use everything in your hand to attack. At the end of your turn you draw up to the intellect amount again. 
                Starting on your opponents turn they can attack you, and you can use cards in your hand to prevent some of the damage they would deal to you.
                However doing this means you will have less cards to attack with on your turn. The game ends when enough damage is dealt to bring a players starting life total (usually 40) to zero.
            </p>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why do I play Flesh and Blood?</h2>
            <p>
                The variance in Flesh and Blood comes from the different playstyles of different players and the characters they choose. 
                Some try to rush you down as quickly as possible, others try to slow you down so that your deck is empty by the end of the game, others try to kill you in one turn by setting up a powerful combo.
                There is math and memorization involved, as well as reading you opponents and trying to predict their cards based on what you've already seen.

            <p>This variance is what makes stratagy in Flesh and Blood interesting and it is why I love playing it so much.</p>
