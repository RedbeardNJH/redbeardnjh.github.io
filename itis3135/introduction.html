            I’m doing a dual major in Computer Science (cybersecurity) and German language. 
            I grew up in both Charlotte, NC and Germany but for the last 10 years I 
            have considered Charlotte my home. I love trading playing card games such as

            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Currently a TA for ITSC 1212 and 1213. 
                I’ve had an internship at the Physics Department at University of Bonn, Germany. 
                Previously worked with ‘Playing for Others’ a Charlotte based nonprofit.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am a full time student at UNCC majoring in both Cybersecurity and German Language.
                I have full certifications from the German government for speaking the language abroad such as the DSD II and the C2 Certificate.
